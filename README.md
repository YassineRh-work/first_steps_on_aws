# 🌤️ Weather Dashboard

A modern **Weather Dashboard** built with **React** and **AWS Amplify**. This application allows users to get real-time weather information by entering a city name. The app is powered by the **OpenWeatherMap API**, **AWS Lambda**, and **API Gateway** for backend functionality. The frontend is a dynamic and user-friendly interface that updates every 15 minutes with the latest weather data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the app running locally on your machine.

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-dashboard.git
cd weather-dashboard
```
### 2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
### 3. Setup env variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenWeatherMap API key. This will be used to fetch weather data.
You can get a free API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up on their website.
```bash
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your-openweathermap-api-key
```
### 4. Run the app locally:
```bash
npm start
```
Your app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## 🔧 API Integration
This app is powered by AWS services and the OpenWeatherMap API:

- The React frontend sends a GET request to the AWS API Gateway endpoint at:
https://cef00mv5yf.execute-api.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/dev/weather?city={cityName}

- API Gateway triggers the AWS Lambda function (weatherproxy), which interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

- The Lambda function returns the weather data back to the frontend, which then displays the weather information to the user.

## 💻 Deployment
This app is deployed using AWS Amplify, allowing for easy deployment and scaling of the app. Amplify automatically handles the hosting of both frontend and backend resources.

## 💾 Backend Configuration
Lambda Function: The weatherproxy Lambda function processes incoming requests from the API Gateway, fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API, and returns the weather data.

API Gateway: The API Gateway routes requests to the Lambda function. It handles CORS and ensures that the frontend can interact with the backend securely.

Amplify CLI: Used to set up and configure AWS resources. For deployment, you can use the following commands:

amplify status: Check the current status of backend resources.

amplify push: Deploy changes to the cloud.

amplify publish: Deploy both frontend and backend.
